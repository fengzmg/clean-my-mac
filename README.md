Clean My Mac
============
    
Mac OS can be very slow after being used for  long time( e.g. 1 year).. Deep clean right now is not possible without
paid software.
    
Most Mac OS cleaner apps doesn't really boost the performance as much as advertised. I have tried all sorts of existing
apps in AppStore, the result wasn't promising.
    
So I come up with an idea of writing a shell script to do this.

I tried on my own 2 mac, Macbook Pro and Macbook Air, with both running Mac OS X 10.9.3.. Result seems to be exceeding my
expectation: 7.5 GB spaces are cleaned, and the system response has been drastically boosted..

Disclaimer
=============
Please read and understand this script before using this script.  Backup your files via Time Machine if need.


Script Usage
=============    
Copy the script to your disk. and execute "sh clean\_my\_mac.sh"
